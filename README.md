## Supervised machine learning
In this project, I will use the famous housing price prediction data and employ the two supervised ml algorithms (classification and regression). The dataset contains total 80 features with In doing so, I will apply many useful techniques (hyperparameter tuning, *scikit-learn* pipelines) to find the best performing model.

### Classification
For this task, the dataset contains the binary label "Expensive", which takes the value of 1 if the price of the house is above certain threshold, e.g., $200,000, and 0 otherwise.
